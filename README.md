# Friend-Finder

# Overview

In this activity, built a compatibility-based "Album FriendFinder" application -- basically a finder app. This full-stack site will take in results of users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

# Instructions

Survey should have 10 questions of our choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

server.js file has the basic npm packages: express, body-parser and path.

html-routes.js file has include two routes:

A GET Route to /survey which should display the survey page. A default USE route that leads to home.html which displays the home page.

A GET route with the url /api/friends. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible friends. A POST routes /api/friends. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic.
